                This is a website created for the 2025 Hacklytics at Georgia Tech. 
                For my project I wanted to showcase the power of information in cybersecurity through a guide free guide to specific threats and 
                best practices. This guide provides insights into common cyber attacks, such as phishing, malware, and social engineering, 
                while also offering actionable steps to enhance personal and organizational security. 
                Whether you're a beginner or an experienced professional, 
                this resource aims to equip you with the knowledge needed to stay safe in an increasingly digital world.
