Phase 1: Planning & Setup
Define Scope
Prioritize MVP features: URL input, basic vulnerability scans (SSL/TLS, headers, SQLi/XSS), and PDF reports.
Decide on the tech stack (e.g., React + Python/Flask or Next.js + Node.js/Express).
Legal Compliance
Draft a Terms of Service (ToS) requiring users to confirm they own/have permission to scan the target site.
Include rate-limiting to prevent abuse of your tool.
Project Setup
Create a GitHub/GitLab repository.
Set up frontend and backend folders (e.g., client/ and server/).

Phase 2: Frontend Development
Build the UI
Input Page: Create a form for users to submit URLs (e.g., using React’s useState for input handling).
Loading State: Add a progress bar/spinner for scans (use WebSocket/SSE later for real-time updates).
Results Dashboard: Design tables/charts to display vulnerabilities (e.g., severity levels: Critical/High/Medium/Low).
Authentication (Optional)
Add a signup/login system (e.g., Firebase Auth or Auth0) if you plan to save user reports.

PDF Export
Use libraries like pdfkit (Node.js) or ReportLab (Python) to generate downloadable reports.
Styling
Use a UI library like Material-UI or Chakra UI for consistent components.
Phase 3: Backend Development
API Endpoints
Create RESTful routes:
POST /scan (trigger a scan).
GET /scan/{id} (fetch scan results).
GET /report/{id} (generate PDF).
Scanning Workflow
Task Queue: Use Celery (Python) or BullMQ (Node.js) to handle async scans.
OWASP ZAP Integration:
Run ZAP in a Docker container or via its API to perform active/passive scans.
Parse ZAP’s XML/JSON report for SQLi, XSS, and header issues.
SSL/TLS Checks: Use the ssl library (Python) or SSL Labs API.
Third-Party API Integration
Shodan: Check for open ports (e.g., port 22, 3306) via shodan-api.
VirusTotal: Submit URLs for malware analysis.
Google Safe Browsing: Detect phishing URLs.
Database Design

Schema for storing scan results (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB):
json
Copy
{
  "scan_id": "123",
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "issues": [
    { "type": "XSS", "severity": "High", "description": "Unsanitized input in search form" }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01"
}
Security
Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., API keys with AWS KMS or cryptography).
Sanitize user inputs to prevent self-targeting attacks on your backend.

Phase 4: Integration
Connect Frontend to Backend
Use Axios or Fetch API to send requests to /scan and poll for results.
Handle errors (e.g., invalid URLs, API rate limits) with toast notifications.
Real-Time Updates
Implement WebSocket (e.g., Socket.io) or Server-Sent Events (SSE) to notify users of scan progress.
Report Generation
Pass scan results from the backend to a PDF template (e.g., HTML → PDF with puppeteer).

Phase 5: Testing
Unit Tests
Test API endpoints (e.g., Jest for Node.js, pytest for Python).
Validate ZAP/Shodan integrations with mock responses.
Penetration Testing
Scan your own tool for vulnerabilities (ironic, but necessary!).
User Testing
Recruit beta testers to validate usability and report false positives.

Phase 6: Deployment
Hosting
Frontend: Vercel/Netlify (React/Next.js) or S3 + CloudFront.
Backend: AWS EC2, Heroku, or Docker containers on Kubernetes.
CI/CD Pipeline
Use GitHub Actions/GitLab CI to automate testing and deployment.
Monitoring
Set up logging (e.g., ELK Stack) and error tracking (Sentry).

Phase 7: Post-Launch
Add Bonus Features
Integrate HaveIBeenPwned API for dark web lookups.
Train a simple ML model (e.g., logistic regression) to predict risks based on historical scan data.
Documentation
Write a user guide and developer docs (e.g., with Swagger for APIs).

Marketing
Share on GitHub, Reddit (r/netsec), and dev forums. Offer a free tier.
Key Tools to Learn
OWASP ZAP: Learn its API and automation scripts.
Celery/Redis: For async task management.
Docker: To containerize ZAP and other tools.
WebSockets: For real-time UI updates.
